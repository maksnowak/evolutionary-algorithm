# Evolutionary algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the evolutionary algorithm with:

- tournament selection (each tournament has two individuals)
- one-point crossover
- Gaussian mutation
- each generation replacing the old one (no individuals from the previous generation stay in the population)

The implementation can be found in `evolutionary.py` file. The repository also contains the Jupyter Notebook file with various experiments (the notebook is in Polish)
